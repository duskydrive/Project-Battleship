## About

I built this Battleship game using pure JavaScript, without any frameworks or libraries. About 25% of the code is covered by TDD (Test-Driven Development).

This project was a great challenge that helped me develop crucial dev skills. Working without libraries and frameworks taught me a lot about how JavaScript really works and why frameworks are greatâ€”they speed things up and make maintenance easier. The hardest part? Programming the opponent computer's brain!

The code quality isn't the best since this was one of my early projects, but I learned a lot from it and it was highly beneficial for my growth as a developer.
